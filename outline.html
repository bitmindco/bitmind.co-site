# Outline

## Basic aspects

- Coordinating P2P teams to produce knowledge and value.
- Prototyping Open Value Networks.
- Exploring collective production of knowledge.
- Mapping decentralized and heterogeneous communities.
- Creating new narratives.
- Contributing to the production of commons for an Open Society. 
- Bringing together the OVN/DAO/DCO concepts.

## Goals

- Build a *commons-based peer production* community around the brand **Bitmind.co**.
- Study the emergence of new narratives and identities.
- Bootstrap Commons Transition for new economic/social/cultural models.
- Preserve both diversity and decentralization of member nodes.
- Explore *OVN* dynamics and develop a *toolbox/ecosystem* while using it.
* Develop an *Open Source* platform to track value flows in *OVNs*.
   * Development of modules to "parse value", from knowledge/time/work metrics
to cryptocurrencies and conversely.
   * Tracking emergence of value at network level and for any individual node.
   * Tracking inter-network flows and the impact of output-commons on other communities.
   * Integrate existing projects by providing interoperability with open standards.

## Theoretical background

- P2P Theory
- Agent-based modeling
- Distributed cognition
- Self-organization
- Autopoiesis
- Complex Adaptive Systems
- Knowledge representation
- Living Systems Model
- Global Brain Initiative
- Sensorica experience.


## Inspiration

* Tiberius Brastaviceanu:

``` latex
An open enterprise is open to participation, which means that anyone can add value. Moreover, it is decentralized in terms of allocation of resources and uses a horizontal governance system. An Open Value Network operates on the Long Tail Mode of Production, which means that a very large number of individuals are responsible of value creation, only a very small percentage of those create maximum value, the great majority of them create very little value, and most of the value is created by those who contribute very little. A prearrangement on revenue is impossible in this context. First, because the process of value creation is very dynamic and relations of production cannot be contract-based. Second, the process involves a great number of individuals that are distributed all over the planet, therefore it is impossible to do time management. There is no instituted power structure, therefore no one can force anyone else to work more. In this case, an algorithm is needed to turn contributions into equity, as contributions are added to the project.

```

* Good explanation of OVN theory in the **P2P Foundation** [site](http://p2pfoundation.net/Open_Value_Network).
* Open Enterprise Model: https://youtu.be/IdcAxGGRafc
* The Open Company Initiative: http://www.opencompany.org/about/
* Peer governance: http://p2pfoundation.net/Category:Peergovernance
* Very good article of Tiberius about tue big question **Why do we need a value accounting system?** in this [site](http://multitudeproject.blogspot.ca/2014/01/why-do-we-need-value-accounting-system.html)

```latex

[...] For example, the value equation takes into consideration the formal reputation of contributors. A higher reputation results in higher equity, all other things being equal, and vice versa. This acts as a stick and a carrot, and regulates behavior. Moreover, the value equation contains parameters to incentivize periodic and frequent contributions. Other factors relate to the quality of execution or of deliverables, and to the priority level of tasks.

```


## Roadmap

* **May-June 2015:**  Bitmind.co Website, Github repo & Twitter Account are opened.
* **June 2015:** We receive a donation of 1000 faircoins from Fair.coop investment campaign.
* **Mid-June 2015:** We start to coordinate with Sensorica and Backfeed.cc and talk about collaborations.
* **July:** We are invited to give a talk in the **Conference of General Artificial Intelligence** in Berlin.

[...]

* Early-August 2015: Working on a Research Paper: Diego González & Vasilis Kostakis
* Mid-August 2015: Release of the "OVN Commons" site to bring common undestanding with Sensorica, Backfeed.cc and other partners, projects and communities.
* September 2015: Publishing a basic "first draft" of the project theoretical and technical basis.
* October-November 2015: Start to define common projects with Backfeed to explore the shared impacts of OVNs and DCOs.


## Research and Development issues

### Metrics to explore

- We need to work in the definition of *value units* or "tokens" to evaluate the *distribution of equity* between the contributors of an Open Value Network.
- We need develop the *value equation* concept and the "exchange equations" to parse cryptocurrency incomes in internal *value units*.
- We need measures to translate time inputs or task accomplishments into the *value units*.
- We need to define voting mechanisms and *hardcoded* self-government rules to guarantee an open democracy in the *Bitmind* community distributedly.
- We need to explore the impact of Blockchain technologies in the implementation of this technical and social infrastructure.

### Outputs

- Source code
- Research papers
- Open Data & Analytics
- Specific sub-projects within the *Bitmind* framework.
- Participation in events

### Inputs

#### Knowledge input

* Activity: 
   * Wiki/Blog posting
   * Software development
   * Transmedia
   * Design
   * Increasing knowledge base
   * Participation in community forums
   * Research papers


#### Economic input

* Accepted cryptocurrencies: *Faircoin, Litecoin, Peercoin, Bitcoin.* ...?
* Ways of receiving economic support:
   * Through donations: 
      * Public wallet addresses for any accepted currency.
      * Social Media campaigns
   * Investment/Sharing: Open form to invest in *Bitmind.co* by buying certain amount of equity, that is, buying *value units* of the project.

### Accountability

* Public access to *Bimind.co* graphs and statistics in order to make public the *value* of the project in the different metrics. I.e.:

   * Amount of wiki articles published
   * Amount of Github commits submitted
   * Amount of posts published
   * Amount of mentions in Social Media
   * Amount of cryptocurrencies received
   * ...

* Distributed accountability: blockchain technologies / ethereum-like frameworks.
* Build a double-way ecosystem with interoperable APIs talking to each other, with forks distributed in different servers.

### Adaptive behavior

*  Communities can be more equalitarian or meritocratic by changing a set of *social equations*. These equations can change by voting mechanisms if there is a proposal.
* Every setting can be modified by using a "formal language", publishing a proposal in the platform. This proposal to modify the configuration of the OVN will be, first of all, tested as "syntactically right" with a technical hard-coded verification, and secondly voted by the community. If it is elected by direct democracy the system will adapt automatically.
* Equity distribution and other variables will not be fixed forever. Democracy and market will be implemented in the core of the system.
